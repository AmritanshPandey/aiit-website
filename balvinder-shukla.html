  <b>About Dr. BALVINDER SHUKLA<br></b>
      <p>The Amity University is a leading private University in the country, having been accredited with ‘Grade-A’<br>
         by National Assessment and Accreditation Council, a statutory body of UGC.</p>
      
      <p>I am delighted to note that Amity Institute of Information Technology (AIIT), an institute under Amity University, UP,<br>
         is taking an initiative to show case its achievements through a newly launched website under the domain of Amity University.</p>

      <p>The information provided through the dedicated link of AIIT will help the students, faculty and all other stakeholders<br>
         to learn more about the academic and research activities of AIIT and the significant role it plays in providing ICT support<br>
         to other institutes of the University.</p>

      <p>The students who are keen to develop their skill and competence in the field of IT would certainly take advantage<br>
         of this platform in pursuit of their academic excellence.</p>

      <p>I offer my sincere compliments and best wishes to all the staff, faculty and students of AIIT and convey my whole<br>
         hearted support and cooperation in making AIIT a Centre of Excellence in the country.</p>
